# 105-unit-3

This is a repository containing instructional materials and datasets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 English-105-30 class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

The repository contains 3 python notebooks, covering the basic topics in coding with Python3 and using the Pandas package for data analysis.

The raw data used was gathered from the [Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library](https://library.unc.edu/data/) and depicts health data by county in every state from 2014-2015. 
Similarly, the Python and Pandas lessons were collected from the [Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library](https://library.unc.edu/data/).

I chose this data because it was well-compiled and represents a plethora of categories by state. The data was compiled for the purpose of using when learning Python and Pandas.

I created a subset of this data, that includes data from only southern states showing the number of Uninsured adults, Preventable hospital stays, Income inequality, and Infant mortality. 

Both the raw data and subset can be used to compare any variables of health data between states, regions, or counties. I will particularly be analyzing how the south compares to other parts of the country.

The following data visualizations were created to compare uninsured adults in southern US states versus income inequality in southern US states. They were created using Datawrapper's map function.
